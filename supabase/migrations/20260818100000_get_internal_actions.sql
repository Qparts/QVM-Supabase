-- QNEW-88: "Actions" tab backing function. Ported from QVM/test (already live there) — not present
-- on QVM/dev. Reuses the exact same tables/status codes the Orders and RFQs tabs already read from
-- (qvm_new_apps.quotation_items.item_status, quotations, confirmed_orders, purchase_orders), so the
-- four buckets stay consistent with what those tabs consider "open"/"closed"/"sent to vendor".
